**Predict diseases based on symptoms**
Dataset created by transforming: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/disease-symptoms-and-patient-profile-dataset
User can enter at most 5 symptoms and get the *prediction for their diseas from 3 intependently running algorithms for accuracy
1. Naive Bayes (Accuracy: 86%)
2. Decision Tree (Accuracy: 90%)
3. Random Forest (Accuracy: Varies between 70%-93%)
The idea behind this project is to eliminate the need for a generalist physician. People should be able to consult a specialist without the "middleman". Although the accuracy of each of them individually does not exceed 95%. But if we go poll the result of each of them, we get ~92% accuracy.

*This should not be used in any measure in a form of medical advice.
